; This procedure constructs a piecewise function metasketch
; that represents a family of piecewise polynomial approximation sketches.
; Each sketch in the family is a piecewise polynomial approximation
; with a fixed number of pieces and a fixed degree for each piece.
;
; The procedure constructs a metasketch M from the following inputs:
;
; * maxpieces : (or/c natural/c +inf.0) is the (inclusive) maximum number of pieces
;   to include in a polynomial approximation.
;
; * maxdegree: (or/c natural/c +inf.0) is the (inclusive) maximum degree of each
;   polynomial in the approximation.
;
; * arity : natural/c is the input arity of the polynomial.
;
; * pre : (listof number?) -> void? emits assertions on (symbolic)
;   inputs that represent preconditions for all programs in M.
;
; * post : program? -> (listof number?) -> void? emits assertions that
;   constrain the output of all programs in M when applied to
;   (symbolic) inputs
;
; * cost-model : (or/c procedure? instruction?) -> natural-number/c
;   is a function that maps each instruction constructor or instance in BV
;   to a natural number representing its cost. The cost model must be additive
;   in the following senses:
;     1. κ(bv) + κ(bvslt) + κ(ite) > 0
;     2. κ(bvmul) + κ(bv) + κ(bvadd) > 0
;   Because it will be used for iteration, the cost model cannot be symbolic.
;
; * order : (or/c #f ((listof number?) . -> . sequence?)) is a procedure
;   that, given the bounds of an index space, produces a sequence that is a
;   search order for that space. If #f, a default search order is used.
