(provide search)

; This procedure implements the top-level search over a metasketch.
;
; * metasketch : constant? is the metasketch over which to search.
;
; * threads : natural/c is the number of threads to run in parallel.
;
; * timeout : natural/c is the timeout for individual sketches in the
; metasketch, in seconds.
;
; * bitwidth : natural/c is the bit-width to finitize to.
;
; * bit-widening : (or/c #f (listof natural/c -1)) is a list of intermediate
;   bitwidths to attempt first, or #f if bit widening should not occur.
;   The list must be sorted and increasing, and should not include the final
;   full bitwidth.
;
; * exchange-samples : boolean? decides whether to share CEXs between solvers
;
; * use-structure : boolean? decides whether to add structure constraints
